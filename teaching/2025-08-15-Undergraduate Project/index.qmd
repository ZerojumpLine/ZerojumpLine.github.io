I mentor a practical course for senior BME undergraduate students. This semester, we will investigate the use of LLMs in medical applications.

## Description

The students are grouped into three teams, each focusing on a critical aspect of medical LLM applications:

### Project Topics

1. **ü©∫ Hallucination Detection** - Developing methods to identify and mitigate false information in medical LLM outputs
2. **üõ°Ô∏è AI Safety** - Ensuring responsible and safe deployment of LLMs in healthcare settings  
3. **üß† Reasoning** - Enhancing logical reasoning capabilities of medical LLMs for better clinical decision support

We will provide foundational code for each project to help students get started, and expect them to conduct research and report their findings.

### Project Materials
