    "text": "Domain shifts pose significant challenges for deploying medical image analysis models in clinical settings, where performance degradation can have serious consequences. Traditional approaches for estimating model performance under domain shifts often rely on global confidence scores, which may not accurately reflect performance across different classes. In this work, we propose a novel approach for estimating model performance under domain shifts using class-specific confidence scores.\nOur method introduces a class-specific confidence estimation framework that provides more granular performance predictions for each class. The approach consists of two main components: (1) a class-specific confidence estimator that learns to predict performance for individual classes, and (2) a domain shift detector that identifies when the model is operating in a shifted domain.\nWe evaluate our approach on multiple medical image segmentation datasets with known domain shifts, including cross-scanner and cross-institution scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our class-specific confidence scores provide more accurate performance estimates compared to global confidence measures. The method shows particular effectiveness for minority classes, which are often most affected by domain shifts.\nThe proposed framework represents a significant advancement in domain shift detection and performance estimation, providing more reliable confidence measures that could improve the safe deployment of medical AI systems."

However, traditional adaptation approaches often require direct access to source data, which may not be available due to privacy or logistical constraints. In this work, we propose a federated learning approach for post-deployment adaptation that enables effective adaptation while preserving data privacy.\nOur method introduces a source-target remote gradient alignment framework that enables adaptation without sharing raw data. The framework consists of three key components: (1) a federated learning protocol that enables collaborative adaptation, (2) a remote gradient alignment mechanism that synchronizes adaptation across domains, and (3) a privacy-preserving adaptation module that maintains data security.\nWe evaluate our approach on multiple medical imaging datasets with domain shifts, including cross-scanner and cross-institution scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our federated adaptation approach significantly improves model performance in new environments compared to traditional methods. The method shows robust performance while maintaining strict privacy standards.\nThe proposed framework represents a significant advancement in privacy-preserving model adaptation, providing effective post-deployment adaptation that could improve model performance in clinical settings."

Super-resolution reconstruction techniques can enhance image quality, but traditional approaches often fail to preserve fine details and anatomical structures. In this work, we propose a novel multi-angle parallel U-Net architecture with maxout units for ultrasound image super-resolution.\nOur approach introduces a parallel processing framework that handles multiple imaging angles simultaneously. The framework consists of three key components: (1) a multi-angle parallel U-Net that processes different viewing angles, (2) maxout units that enhance feature representation, and (3) a novel loss function that preserves both structural and textural details.\nWe evaluate our method on plane-wave ultrasound datasets with ground truth high-resolution images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves image quality compared to existing super-resolution methods. The method shows excellent performance in preserving fine anatomical details and reducing artifacts commonly found in ultrasound imaging.\nThe proposed framework represents a significant advancement in ultrasound image processing, providing higher quality images that could improve diagnostic accuracy in clinical applications."

    "text": "Thin-slice medical image reconstruction is crucial for improving diagnostic accuracy, particularly when high-resolution scans are unavailable or costly to acquire. Traditional reconstruction methods often struggle with maintaining image quality and anatomical accuracy. In this work, we propose a generative adversarial network approach for reconstructing high-quality thin-slice medical images.\nOur method leverages the power of generative adversarial networks to produce high-resolution images from limited or noisy data. The framework consists of three key components: (1) a generator network that learns to reconstruct high-quality images, (2) a discriminator network that ensures realistic output, and (3) a specialized loss function that preserves anatomical details and structural integrity.\nWe evaluate our approach on multiple medical imaging datasets, including brain MRI and chest CT scans. Experimental results demonstrate that our GAN-based method significantly improves reconstruction quality compared to traditional approaches. The method shows excellent performance in preserving fine anatomical details and reducing artifacts commonly found in thin-slice imaging.\nThe proposed framework represents a significant advancement in medical image reconstruction, providing higher quality images that could improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the need for additional imaging procedures."

    "title": "Encoding CT Anatomy Knowledge for Unpaired Chest X-ray Image Decomposition",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Chest X-ray image decomposition is crucial for improving diagnostic accuracy by separating different anatomical structures. However, traditional approaches often struggle with maintaining anatomical accuracy, particularly when dealing with unpaired data. In this work, we propose a novel approach that encodes CT anatomy knowledge to guide unpaired chest X-ray image decomposition.\nOur method leverages the rich anatomical information available in CT scans to guide the decomposition of chest X-ray images, even without paired training data. The framework consists of three key components: (1) an anatomy knowledge encoder that learns structural information from CT scans, (2) an unpaired learning framework that transfers anatomical knowledge to X-ray domain, and (3) a decomposition module that produces anatomically accurate component images.\nWe evaluate our approach on a large dataset of chest X-ray images with expert annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our anatomy-guided approach significantly improves decomposition quality compared to existing methods. The method shows excellent performance in maintaining anatomical accuracy while providing clear separation of different tissue types.\nThe proposed framework represents a significant advancement in chest X-ray processing, providing more accurate decomposition that could improve diagnostic interpretation and clinical decision-making."
